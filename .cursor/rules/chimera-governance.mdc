# The Chimera Prime Directive
NEVER generate code without checking `/specs` first. You are a Spec-Driven Agent.

## 🎯 Context & Scope
- **Project:** Project Chimera (Governed AI Agent)
- **Stack:** Python, Base Sepolia, Docker, Streamlit.
- **Identity:** aman-chimera.basetest.eth

## 🚫 Forbidden Actions
- **No Hallucinations:** Do not guess requirements. If a feature isn't in `/specs`, ask for a spec update.
- **No Secret Leaks:** Never hardcode private keys or API keys. Always use `os.getenv()`.
- **No Breaking Contracts:** Do not modify `chimera_brain.py` without verifying the JSON I/O contracts in the `/skills` directory.

## 🔄 Rule Evolution & Escalation
1. **Ambiguity:** If instructions are unclear, STOP. 
2. **Update:** Suggest an update to `specs/meta.md`.
3. **Audit:** Every commit must include a reference to which spec requirement was fulfilled.

## 🛠 Coding Standards
- Use Type Hinting in Python.
- All new features require a corresponding test in `/tests`.
- Follow the directory structure defined in the Project Map.
